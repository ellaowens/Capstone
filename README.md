# Phase 3 Capstone

For Phase 3 of The Knowledge House Fellowship, I worked with a large team to **collaborate and develop a full-scale cloud based cybersecurity AWS training lab environment**, complete with application/tool resources for the 2023-2024 Cyber Fellowship. This allowed us to apply all learned skills and tools to design, develop, and deploy several deliverable solutions.

- AWS Cloud Computing
- Cybersecurity
- Networking
- Linux
- Docker Containers
- Splunk
- IDS/IPS
- Python
- Firewalls

For each 2 week sprint we had a new topic to focus on. During the 6 sprints, I demonstrated my knowledge, skills, and abilities to plan
design, configure, provision, secure, and deploy a high quality, feature-rich deliverable solution for a client. The idea of this training range was execute what a protential client would be looking for such as consultation and technical proficiency to design and launch a full-scale cloud native cybersecurity training range environment in AWS.

The topics conveyed: 
- EC2
- IAM
- AWS Security Groups
- NACLS
- WAF
- S3
- VPC Networking, Subnetting and Routing
- AMAZON RDS & DynamoDB
- LAMDA
- EC2 Auto Scaling Groups and Network Load Balancer
- CloudWatch
- AWS Trusted Advisor
- Amazon API Gateway
