# Phase 3 Capstone ðŸ”— [Cybersecurity Training Range](https://github.com/cybertrainingrange/cybertraininingrange.io/blob/main/README.md) 

In Phase 3 of The Knowledge House Fellowship, I had the privilege of collaborating with a diverse and talented team to **conceive and develop a comprehensive cloud-based cybersecurity** [**AWS training lab environment**](https://github.com/cybertrainingrange/cybertraininingrange.io/blob/main/README.md) . This lab was thoughtfully designed to provide essential resources and tools for the upcoming TKH Cybersecurity Fellowship, allowing us to leverage our collective expertise and apply a wide array of skills and technologies to create practical solutions.

Our project spanned multiple domains, encompassing *AWS Cloud Computing, Cybersecurity, Networking, Linux, Docker Containers, Splunk, IDS/IPS, Python, and Firewalls*. Organized into six two-week sprints, we dedicated each sprint to a distinct aspect of our project. Throughout these sprints, I had the opportunity to showcase my proficiency in planning, designing, configuring, provisioning, securing, and deploying high-quality, feature-rich solutions for our client.

The primary objective of our cybersecurity training range was to emulate the expectations of a potential client, demanding both consultation and technical expertise. Our aim was to successfully design and launch a comprehensive, cloud-native cybersecurity training range environment within AWS, effectively demonstrating our capabilities and dedication to meeting the client's needs. This project not only allowed us to apply our knowledge but also served as a testament to our commitment to excellence in the realm of cybersecurity.
