# Phase 3 Capstone ðŸ”— [Cybersecurity Training Range](https://github.com/cybertrainingrange/cybertraininingrange.io/blob/main/README.md) 

For Phase 3 of The Knowledge House Fellowship, I worked with a large team to **collaborate and develop a full-scale cloud based cybersecurity AWS training lab environment**, complete with application/tool resources for the next TKH Cyber Fellowship. This allowed us to apply all learned skills and tools to design, develop, and deploy several deliverable solutions.

- AWS Cloud Computing
- Cybersecurity
- Networking
- Linux
- Docker Containers
- Splunk
- IDS/IPS
- Python
- Firewalls

For each 2 week sprint focused on a new topic. During the 6 sprints, I demonstrated my knowledge, skills, and abilities to plan
design, configure, provision, secure, and deploy a high quality, feature-rich deliverable solution for a client. The idea of this training range was to execute what a protential client would be looking for, such as consultation and technical proficiency, to design and launch a full-scale cloud native cybersecurity training range environment in AWS.
